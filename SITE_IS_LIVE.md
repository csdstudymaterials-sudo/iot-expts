# ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - SITE IS NOW LIVE!

## 🎉 Final Status: FULLY DEPLOYED AND WORKING

**Site URL:** https://roohithbala.github.io/iot-expts/

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### The Problem:
- GitHub Pages was serving from repository root (/)
- Root index.html was trying to load `/src/main.jsx` (source files)
- Source files don't exist in deployed version
- Result: **404 errors**

### The Solution:
1. ✅ **Created redirect in root index.html**
   - Automatically redirects to `./docs/index.html`
   - Both meta refresh and JavaScript redirect
   - Works even if JavaScript is disabled

2. ✅ **Complete docs folder with all assets**
   - All React bundles (JS/CSS)
   - All images (ESP32, Raspberry Pi, KEC banner)
   - All static files (.nojekyll, 404.html)

3. ✅ **GitHub Actions workflow**
   - Builds to `docs` folder
   - Uploads to GitHub Pages
   - Auto-deploys on every push
